<h2>Voyant Text Analysis</h2>
<p>I chose to analayze Arabic poem by a famous poet "Antara" from the pre-Islamic Era.</p>
<p>I have only analyzed one poem to see what the result would be, its a very long poem).</p>
<p>I actually havent used Voyant before, but learning about it and how people used it gave me an idea on how to better understand it.</p>

<p>As we can see. the analysis is different from any other voyant. The words that were repeated are unique and rare to see them in any other poem. The most used words are,  verily (16); left (7); like (7); long (7); mouth (7)

  <p> The result is kind of confusing , the words that were repeated are different from the original text. However, other words can be seen in the Arabic poem.

<p> my conclusion is, after using voyant, I see that the result is different , I can see that the translation played a role in this change. This is a veryy hard poem to read in Arabic, but also, after seeing all of the words, there are similarity<p/>
