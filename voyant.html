<h2>Voyant Text Analysis</h2>
<p>I chose to analayze Arabic poem by a famous poet "Antara" from the pre-Islamic Era.</p>
<p>I have only analyzed one poem to see what the result would be, its a very long poem).</p>
<p>I actually havent used Voyant before, but learning about it and how people used it gave me an idea on how to better understand it.</p>

<p>As we can see. the analysis is different from any other voyant. The words that were repeated are unique and rare to see them in any other poem. The most used words are,  verily (16); left (7); like (7); long (7); mouth (7)
   I dont know why these word were repeated , Verily for instance was in the Arabic text maybe once.The other words usage in the Arabic text are : Left was the second word in the first line of the poem. Like was  repeated in some lines as a way to desriebs something   , and mouth was repeated three times in the Arabic text.Long was repeated and used as a metaphore </p>

  <p> The result is kind of confusing , the words that were repeated are different from the original text. However, other words can be seen in the Arabic poem.
  Surprisingly  , the Arabic text Analysis was about preposition of Arabic language   like " on, non, not" , my thought about this is that because this poem is very old from the pre-Islamic era, so most of the words are unknown even in Arabic. Or maybe the translation was not accurate enough to be interpreted? </p>

<p> As I was reading the analysis in Englihs, I see that the word " Verily" means " truly, Am I right". Its like when Antara wa trying to inform  the readers of his honesty, and his love for his cousin. It can also mean an oath, people before Islam used this word a lot especially poets. And Antara used this to tell his tribe of their mistakes</p> 
  <p> My conclusion is: I think that the English analysis was more accurate, after I read the Arabic poem many times, I see how the words I mentioned above were in the original text. while the Arabic text result was about prepositions, and  I dont know why the result was about this. </p>
