<h2>Voyant Text Analysis</h2>
<p>I chose to analayze Arabic poem by a famous poet from the pre-Islamic Era.</p>
<p>I have only analyzed one poem to see what the result would be, its avery long poem).</p>
<p>I actually havent used Voyant before, but learning about it and how people use gave me an idea on how understand it.</p>

<p>As we can see. the analayxing differnt from any other voyant. The words that were repeated are unique and rare to see it in any other poem. The most used words are,  verily (16); left (7); like (7); long (7); mouth (7)

  <p> The rrsult is kind of confused me, the words that were reapeated are diffrent from the original text. However, most of the other words are clearly seen that are in the original text

<p> my conclusion is, after using voyant, I see that the result is different , I can see that the translation played a role in this change. This is a veryy hard poem to read in Arabic, but also, after seeing all of the words, there are similarity<p/>
